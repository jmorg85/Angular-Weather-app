2. Once there you enter the basic information and they should send you an API key for you to access it how you see fit.
3. To access the documentation of this API, please follow this link here: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
4. Here are the results when I look at the current weather of Chicago. ![image](https://github.com/jmorg85/Angular-Weather-app/assets/15697425/d48e1439-2072-4299-9e80-ddb901b1df39)
